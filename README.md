* Make two classes:
  * One for Word
  * One for Definition
* The homepage of the app should list all Words, and allow users to click a Word to view all its Definitions.
* A user should be able to add their own Word to the dictionary.
* When viewing a Word, users should also be able to add one or more unique Definitions.
